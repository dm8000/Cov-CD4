# Cov-CD4
Data that was extracted from multiple databases used in the preprint https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20200329v1

# T1.txt, T2.txt and T3.txt
These tables were used to generate Extended Figure 1.
T1.txt and T2.txt data were extracted from https://www.proteinatlas.org the first has NX expression values (calcuated through the consesus of multiple databases) and the second has subjective protein expression (immunohistochemistry).
T3.txt data was extracted from http://biogps.org/ in arbitrary units (microarray)

# T4.txt
This table was used to generate extended Figure 3a.
The data were extracted from the following sources:
Viral interaction data was extracted from http://phipster.org 
Plasma membrane genes:
https://www.proteinatlas.org (predicted membrane proteins that are not secreted)
https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/ (Jensen compartments libraries for Cell Surface, Plasma Membrane and External Side of Plasma Membrane)
http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/ (GO:0005887)

# T5.txt
This table was used to generate extended Figure 3b and based on results given by https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/ with all Sars-Cov-1 proteins predicted to interact with human proteins.
